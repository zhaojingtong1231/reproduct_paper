**ProG** (_Prompt Graph_) is a library built upon PyTorch to easily conduct single or multiple task prompting for a
pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The idea is derived from the paper: Xiangguo Sun, Hong Cheng, JIa Li,
etc. [All in One: Multi-task Prompting for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01504). KDD2023, in which
they released the raw
codes at [Click](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mpg/README.md). This repository is a **polished version** of the raw
codes
with **[Extremely Huge Changes and Updates:](https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG/blob/main/History.md#13-jul-2023)**

## Call for Contributors!

Once you are invited as the contributor, you would be asked to follow the following steps:

- step 1. create a temp branch (e.g. ``xgTemp``) from the latest ``xgsun``. (``xgsun`` branch is a beta branch and only ``xgsun`` can be merged to the ``main`` branch.)
- step 2. fetch ``origin/xgTemp`` to your local ``xgTemp``, and make your own changes via PyCharm etc.
- step 3. push your changes from local ``xgTemp`` to your github cloud branch: ``origin/xgTemp``.
- step 4. open a full request to merge from your branch to ``xgsun``.

When you finished all these jobs. I will get a notification and I will approve to merge your branch to ``xgsun``. 
Once I finished, I will delete your branch, and next time you will repeat the above jobs.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could finish all these jobs during week days (Monday-Friday, Beijing Timezone). 
I will handle with the conflict issues during weekends and update the latest ``xgsun`` branch before Sunday (Beijing Timezone)

A widely tested ``xgsun`` branch will then be merged to the ``main`` branch and new version will be released one or two times per month.


## Quick Start


### Package Dependencies

- PyTorch 1.13.1
- torchmetrics 0.11.4
- torch_geometric 2.2.0

### Pre-train your GNN model

The following codes present a simple example on how to pre-train a GNN model via GraphCL. You can also find a integrated function ``pretrain()`` in ``no_meta_demo.py``.
```python
from ProG.utils import mkdir, load_data4pretrain
from ProG import PreTrain

mkdir('./pre_trained_gnn/')

pretext = 'GraphCL'  # 'GraphCL', 'SimGRACE'
gnn_type = 'TransformerConv'  # 'GAT', 'GCN'
dataname, num_parts, batch_size = 'CiteSeer', 200, 10

print("load small_data...")
graph_list, input_dim, hid_dim = load_data4pretrain(dataname, num_parts)

print("create PreTrain instance...")
pt = PreTrain(pretext, gnn_type, input_dim, hid_dim, gln=2)

print("pre-training...")
pt.train(dataname, graph_list, batch_size=batch_size,
         aug1='dropN', aug2="permE", aug_ratio=None,
         lr=0.01, decay=0.0001, epochs=100)


```

### Create Relative Models

```python
from ProG.prompt import GNN, LightPrompt
from torch import nn, optim
import torch

# load pre-trained GNN
gnn = GNN(100, hid_dim=100, out_dim=100, gcn_layer_num=2, gnn_type="TransformerConv")
pre_train_path = './pre_trained_gnn/{}.GraphCL.{}.pth'.format("CiteSeer", "TransformerConv")
gnn.load_state_dict(torch.load(pre_train_path))
print("successfully load pre-trained weights for gnn! @ {}".format(pre_train_path))
for p in gnn.parameters():
    p.requires_grad = False

# prompt with hand-crafted answering template (no answering head tuning)
PG = LightPrompt(token_dim=100, token_num_per_group=100, group_num=6, inner_prune=0.01)

opi = optim.Adam(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, PG.parameters()),
                 lr=0.001, weight_decay=0.00001)

lossfn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='mean')

```
The above codes are also integrated as a function ``model_create(dataname, gnn_type, num_class, task_type)`` in this project. 

### Prompt learning with hand-crafted answering template
```python
from ProG.data import multi_class_NIG
import torch

train, test,_,_ = multi_class_NIG(dataname, num_class)
gnn, PG, opi, lossfn, _, _ = model_create(dataname, gnn_type, num_class, task_type)
prompt_epoch = 200  # 200
# training stage
PG.train()
emb0 = gnn(train.x, train.edge_index, train.batch)
for j in range(prompt_epoch):
    pg_batch = PG.inner_structure_update()
    pg_emb = gnn(pg_batch.x, pg_batch.edge_index, pg_batch.batch)
    dot = torch.mm(emb0, torch.transpose(pg_emb, 0, 1))
    sim = torch.softmax(dot, dim=1)
    train_loss = lossfn(sim, train.y)
    print('{}/{} training loss: {:.8f}'.format(j, prompt_epoch, train_loss.item()))
    opi.zero_grad()
    train_loss.backward()
    opi.step()
```
